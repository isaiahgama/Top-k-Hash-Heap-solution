The makfile provided is the same as what is on gradescope.
The reference output files include the K used in the name. 
So for example test_ip0_15.out is the reference output for test_ip0.in called with k = 15. 
    
You can invoke this with the following
```
./main input_files/test_ip0.in sample_output.out 15
``` 

Then you can use the diff command to compare sample_output.out (produced by your program) with test_ip0_15.out (the reference solution).
